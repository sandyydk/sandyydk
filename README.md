### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Cloud Cost Optimization at Harness. This involves a broad distributed architecture with several moving parts. tech language mostly happens to be Golang (Go). But I also work with Envoy, K8s, PostgreSQL, Redis, Queuing stack and a little bit of scripting occasionally. Work also involves lots of cloud technologies across cloud providers like AWS, GCP and Azure using features like EC2, S3, Lambda, ECS and many more. That's enough of my work for now. More to come.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about CI/CD practices and Software Development at scale. Cloud cost optimization is one more of my interests. Love working on multi-cloud technologies.
